    <h1>Cycling capital of the world "Amsterdam"</h1>
    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>Amsterdam is the capital of the country netherlands and it is also called the cycling capital of the world.In this city 75% students use their cycles to go to their schools and only 19 percent people use their car in their daily uses.This citi's area is around 200 square kilometers and the cycle tracks which have been laid in this city is more than 400 kilometers.</p>

    <h2>It wasn't like this always! </h2>
    <p>Now suprisingly this city was not like this always.In 1950's and 1960's cars and petrolium trasports became popular with the economic boom in this country.Government started to demolish buildings to make space for roads so that cars could run on them.In 1950 the cycle usage in this country was about 80% and In 1970 it remained onlt 20%, So there was a massive decrease in the cycle usage in this country from year 1950 to 1970. Now as the popularity of the cars increase the accidents also increased in this country and mainly in the city Amsterdam. 1971 was the peak year of the traffic accidents in the city Amsterdam. In this one year there were 3,300 deaths due to car accidents and more than 400 children died in these accidents.</p>

    <h2>A miracle</h2>
    <p>In 1970's some miracle happened, People realised how detrimental these cars were for this city and the people started a Civil disobediance and named it Stop de Kindermoord that is stop the murder of childern because so many childers were killed because of this traffic accedents happening due to these cars and other petrolium transports. People also started rallies and differents ways of protests against thr usage of cars. </p>

    <h2>A kind police and government</h2>
    <p>The police in this city Amsterdam was very understandable and insted of taking charges aginst these people they supported the the movements and rallies. The politicians were also very kind and looked into this problem. They heard the voices of the people, accepted the problem. The governments also subsidiced the movement.</p>

    <h2>No way other than cycles</h2>
    <p>In the year 1973 the oil crises started and the price of petrol became 4 times and now for people taking cars became more difficult.The people here were not willing to use the cars due to the increasing accidents and childern deaths and additionally people were forced to not use the cars to the oil crises and increase of rates of petrolium.</p>

    <h2>The development towards cycle usage</h2>
    <p>The goverment of Amsterdam finally started the mission to reduce the cars usage and increase the cycle usage. The goverment started with the car free sundays where no one can use the cars on this day. They also started to lay the cycle tracks and painted it with red colour. They also realised that one or two cycle tracks were not sufficient they needed to lay the network of cycle tracks in order to motivate people to use cycles insted of cars. They laid the cycle tracks all over the city in order to connect each and every point of the city. If a person want to go let's say point A to point B he can easily go throung the cycle tracks on his cycle. It wasn't like just connecting the cycle tracks with one or two main roads.</p>

    <p>Lots of cycle tracks were laid in the city and block by block government started to ristrict the usage of cars. As of 2021 government tries to find new ways to motivate to ride cycles and reduce car usage. Like increaing car parking fees to reduce using cars, block by block banning pollution trasports and making new cycle tracks. They also made publictrasport for childern below 12 years free to moyivate to use publictrasport in their childhood it self to use the publictrasport insted of cars.</p>
